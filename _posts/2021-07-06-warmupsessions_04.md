In this installment of Warmup Sessions I decided to kick it up a notch with some 138 bpm uplifting trance with splashes of vocals. Tracks all sourced from Juno Download again as it's turning out to be my go-to source for choons.

Hopefully you'll enjoy this fast paced, high energy set, with vocals from Emma Hewitt, Audrey Gallagher and Aruna.  Big Sky is an old favorite of mine and this is a new remix by Andrew Rayel. Packed full of energy at the half way point of the mix.  To be honest, I love all the tracks so would be hard pushed to find a favorite, although I do have a soft spot for the melody of the final track "Now We Are Free", which you should recognise from the film Gladiator.

Enjoy!
