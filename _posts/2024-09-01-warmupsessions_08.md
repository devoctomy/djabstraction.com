As the UK summer lingers, I'm thrilled to bring you an extended episode of Warmup Sessions, packed with the latest and greatest in uplifting trance. This mix isn't just a playlist, it's a journey through euphoric highs and pounding basslines, meticulously crafted to elevate your
spirits and get your pulse racing.

I spent serious time refining this one, reworking the sequence to perfection. Along the way, I decided to slip in a timeless gem, Pagoda by Niklas Harding & Redshift, an all-time favourite of mine that still hits like a lightning bolt.

Favourites of mine would be Ashley, by Peri & Filo, featuring the amazing vocals of Aruna, one of, if not the best female Trance vocalist. Home by Coast 2 Coast, for its Techno-like, heavy basslines that leads nicely into Pagoda, one of my all time favourites.

Whether you're driving through city lights or lost in your own space, I promise this mix will take you places. Crank up the volume, lose yourself in the sound, and enjoy the ride. Happy listening!
