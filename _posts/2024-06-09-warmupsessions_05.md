It's been a long time since my last Warmup Sessions was released. Life is always happening but I've been itching to get back at it and finally got there.

This mix is high energy, uplifting, main floor Trance. Comprising of a mixture of female vocals and instrumentals. All tracks were sourced from Beatport, of which there were plenty to choose from. I was truly spoilt for choice.

Some of my favourites from this mix are 'When It's Over' by Derek Ryan and Sarah De Warren for its uplifting, driving melody overlaid with awesome vocals. Also The Betweenlands by Adove and PCY as that melody is just fantastic.

Enjoy and I hope it was worth the wait!
