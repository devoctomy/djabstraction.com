I was Lost in Sound, letting the noise drown out everything I couldn't face.

Then Winter Took Over, and all the warmth I had clung to disappeared.

I Never Saw You Coming, sudden like thunder, beautiful like danger.

I kept walking, hoping To Find Myself somewhere far from the wreckage.

I dreamed of an Ordinary World, one without masks or silence.

Then she appeared, Natalia, with eyes full of secrets and something softer.

I looked at her and whispered, "Save Me From Myself," and for once I meant every word.

We stepped into a Parallel Universe, where nothing had to make sense to feel real.

In her light, I found the Beauty In My Scars, and let go of shame.

I decided to begin again Today, no more waiting for life to start.

Fire stirred in my chest, the rise of a Dragon Heart long asleep.

Everything around me turned Sunlit, even the shadows began to smile.

I let go of the Black Rose, wilted and worn, the last piece of the man I used to be.

Now I run toward A Million Dreams, and every one of them feels possible.

## DJ Abstraction - Warmup Sessions 16 Introduction

## Verse 1
I was falling fast,
Lost in Sound,
Chasing echoes
Where no peace is found.
Then came the cold,
Winter Took Over,
Froze my soul
And I couldn't recover.

## Chorus
You were the light I didn't expect,
Never Saw You Coming, but now I reflect.
You pulled me up when I fell,
You helped me To Find Myself.

## Verse 2
I wanted calm,
An Ordinary World,
But shadows swayed,
And the truth unfurled.
Then she arrived,
Whispered her name,
Natalia,
And nothing stayed the same.

## Chorus
You were the light I didn't expect,
Never Saw You Coming, but now I reflect.
You pulled me up when I fell,
You helped me To Find Myself.

## Bridge 1
I said the words
I'd never dared,
Save Me From Myself,
Too far to care.
We slipped away
To a place unknown,
A Parallel Universe,
Where we stood alone.

## Chorus
You were the light I didn't expect,
Never Saw You Coming, but now I reflect.
You pulled me up when I fell,
You helped me To Find Myself.

## Bridge 2
Now I see the Beauty In My Scars,
I choose Today, beneath the stars.
With my Dragon Heart, I come alive,
In the Sunlit dawn, I rise and thrive.
Dropped the Black Rose, my former skin,
To chase A Million Dreams within.
Within.

## Final Chorus
You were the light I didn't expect,
Never Saw You Coming, but now I reflect.
You pulled me up when I fell,
You helped me To Find Myself.
