I was lost & found in the endless black, drifting through space in search of a new home.

Memories turned to tears as I left Earth behind, knowing there was no return.

Waiting for night to fall, I stared out at the void, wondering if I'd made a mistake.

For now, I was safe in sound, the hum of my ship the only comfort.

A stellar flare erupted nearby, its beauty disguising the deadly radiation it carried.

Beyond the last colony, there was nothing but a void between stars, an abyss swallowing all light.

Saying goodbye forever to familiarity, I set course for the unknown.

The loneliness felt like a ghost reality, echoes of voices that were never there.

A distant signal from Ceres gave me hope-perhaps I wasn't alone after all.

But my own fears were kryptonite, threatening to break my resolve.

Finally, after years in darkness, I saw city lights, glowing on a distant world.

A new future awaited me, one I had only dreamed of.

Through the burning storms of Mercure, I made my final descent.

And as I touched solid ground, I knew peace would come if we stay.

DJ Abstraction - Warmup Sessions 13 Introduction

[Verse 1]

I was lost & found in the dark of space,
Drifting alone, with a dream to chase.
Memories turned to tears, but I won't look back,
Through the endless night, I stay on track.

[Chorus]

Night to fall, safe in sound,
Through the storm, I'm heaven-bound.
Stellar lights, void between stars,
I keep on flying, no matter how far.

[Verse 2]

Said goodbye forever, left my past behind,
A ghost reality echoes in my mind.
Through the dust of Ceres, I hear a call,
But kryptonite fears could end it all.

[Chorus]

Night to fall, safe in sound,
Through the storm, I'm heaven-bound.
Stellar lights, void between stars,
I keep on flying, no matter how far.

[Bridge]

Through the dark, I see city lights,
A spark of hope in endless nights.
A brand-new future, a place to be,
Through the flames of Mercure, it's calling me-
But only if we stay, will we finally be free.

[Chorus]

Night to fall, safe in sound,
Through the storm, I'm heaven-bound.
Stellar lights, void between stars,
I keep on flying, no matter how far.
