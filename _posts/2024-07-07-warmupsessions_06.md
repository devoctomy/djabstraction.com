Well I've actually managed to keep schedule this month, let's hope that this continues!

This month I have decided to stick with the theme of Uplifting Trance with splashings of sublime vocals. Beatport seems to be absolutely full to the brim of amazing Trance these days so it wasn't particularly difficult in finding this selection of beauties for you.

Featuring top liners such as Mike Shiver and Ronski Speed, with vocals from the awesome Jennifer Rene, this mix should hopefully whisk you away to another place for an hour and get that blood pumping to the high pace baselines and euphoric melodies. My personal favourite is 'Alone' by Jennifer Rene and Roman Messer, amazing vocals, albeit slightly haunting.

Enjoy!
