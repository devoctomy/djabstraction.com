You may or may not have noticed that episodes 1-4 have disappeared from the mixes page as well as the podcast stream. This is simply because I do not feel they are up to scratch with the latest set of mixes.

I originally called this series 'Warmup Sessions' as I was extremely out of practice when I started. It took me a while to build up the enthusiasm to get back into it proper, and now I feel that I am there I thought that it only makes sense to remove the mixes that I wouldn't recommend anyone listen to.
