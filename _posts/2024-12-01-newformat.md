Hey everyone, those of you who read the show notes will have noticed that I had something different planned, starting from this months episode of Warmup Sessions.

Although what I have done for this month is likely to change slightly as I flesh out the concept more, you will notice that I no longer provide my own commentary on an episiode. Instead I have provided a short story, where each sentence introduces a track in the mix. Obviously I have done this with the aid of ChatGPT, but I'm hoping that it doesn't seem to cheesy for this reason.

As well as this, I have also created a track using Suno (AI) which features the same story in song form. This track has then been included at the beginning of the mix, as an introduction, and hopefully as a way to bring cohesion and additional structure to the mix ahead.

But that's not all, I've also created a video to go with the track, featuring images I have generated using FLUX and then turned into video clips using Kling. Yes there is an awful lot of AI going into this, but fear not, the mix is entirely of my doing, as usual, that will not change.

A YouTube channel will be coming soon, in the meantime, enjoy!
