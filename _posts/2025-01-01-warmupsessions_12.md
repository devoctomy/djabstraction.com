A Song of Remedy lingered in the stillness, soft and faint.

In quiet Resonation, the echoes of a voice grew louder.

A relentless Sea Storm tore through the fragile tether that held them.

Left adrift, untethered After the End, they parted ways.

Was it Forever, or just a guise? The question hung beneath the skies.

"I still Miss You..." whisper to the empty night.

Just a Fool, chasing shadows and signs.

An elusive Indicator glimmered, its meaning blurred.

To heal, it was necessary to Lose Control, to abandon what was once held.

And so, returned Back to Where We Started, seeking solace.

Now Seeing the Light, the path ahead appeared, clear and strong.

It was time to Believe, not in what was lost, but in what could be.

Through the Deepest Fear, the courage to move forward emerged.

And at last, they learned how to Love Again Like That, no looking back.

#### DJ Abstraction - Warmup Sessions 12 Introduction

[Verse 1]

A Song of Remedy, whispered low,
Gentle Resonation, echoes grow.
The Sea Storm rages, we drift apart,
Left untethered, After the End, we part.

[Chorus]

Was it Forever, or just a guise?
I still Miss You, beneath the skies.

[Verse 2]

I was Just a Fool, chasing signs,
An Indicator, in blurred lines.
Lose Control, retrace the start,
Go Back to Where We Started, heart to heart.

[Chorus]

Was it Forever, or just a guise?
I still Miss You, beneath the skies.

[Bridge]

Seeing the Light, shadows fade,
I Believe in paths we've made.

[Chorus]

Was it Forever, or just a guise?
I still Miss You, beneath the skies.

[Verse 3]

Through my Deepest Fear, I'll find my track,
To Love Again Like That, no looking back.
