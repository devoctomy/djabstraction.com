This is the second installment of 'Warmup Sessions', a series I have decided to use in a way that I can practice my mixing skills and track selections without being dead set on a specific genre, theme or release schedule. So expect these mixes to be uploaded pretty randomly

For 'Warmup Sessions 01' I purchased all the tracks through Beatport, but didn't have a great experience whilst doing so, although I do love the site, the search capabilities of can be a bit underwhealming with certain criteria, it will take some getting used to; I'm sure. So this month I went to Junodownload for the first time, and was quite pleased.

I've gone for another selection of Uplifting Vocal Trance tracks, with Craig Connelly featuring a number of times. I particularly like the Gareth Emery remix of Bobina's Time & Tide, the original of which is one of my favourites.  Another favorite of mine in this mix is Hypnotic by Fabrice, it comes in at a crucial time in the mix and keeps up the energy levels nicely, with an sublime uplifting breakdown.

As always, enjoy the mix!
