Well after quite a length break from doing DJ mixes of any kind, I'm back, during the times of Covid lockdowns and working from home every day, what better way to spend some of my new found time?

I've decided to avoid using CDs this time, which should help cut down on some of the annoyances bought about by my previous routines. So I'm using a Pioneer all-in-one controller, can't get enough of that Pioneer kit, although the Denon range does look rather tasty; this generation.

All that aside, I've decided to do regular mixes and post them onto my own website, thankfully the domain (djabstraction.com) was still available so I've snapped that up again. I'll be doing the usual range of House, Trance, Progressive, so I hope you find something you like.

This will be the first mix to appear on the new site (when it's done), at the time of writing this I haven't got anything up just yet but it shouldn't take me long.

Now for this mix, it's packed full of energetic female vocal trance, with a couple of instrumental tracks to help build atmosphere, such as Shöneberg which I absolutely love. There are also a couple of classics in there, from Late Night Alumni and Marcel Woods that I couldn't resist. Enjoy, and if you have any feedback, please get in touch!
