<p>Sup! Thanks for visiting my site. This is the place where I would like to share my DJ mixes with you, ranging from House to Trance, basically anything I like the sound of, all mixed from my bedroom, so I'm a literal bedroom DJ.</p>

<p>Some of you may remember me from <a href="http://ah.fm/">Afterhours.fm</a>, where I had a monthly show titled '<a href="http://djabstraction.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/">Beyond Consciousness</a>'. It ran for 20 months (shows) and ended in 2009, since then I only shared a few mixes on various forums. Shit happens, your life changes and before you know it, 12 years have passed.</p>

<p>Now it's 2021 and we are confined to our homes whilst Covid does a number on us. Personally, even though times are crazy, I've found that I've managed to reclaim some free time so that I can start taking up some old hobbies again. Thus, I'm back, I hope you are all well and enjoy the mixes that I have uploaded for you.</p>
