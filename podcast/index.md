To make listening to my mixes as easy as possible I've created a Podcast feed which you should be able to subscribe to using any good Podcast player on your smartphone or other device.

Once you have picked a podcast player and have installed it to your device, you will need to subscribe to the following DJ Abstraction Podcast feed,

[https://www.djabstraction.com/feed/podcast.xml](https://www.djabstraction.com/feed/podcast.xml)

> This feed link is available at the bottom of every page via the social links.

Once subscribed you should receieve notifications of new mixes as they go live and be able to listen straight away without any messing about.

Enjoy!
